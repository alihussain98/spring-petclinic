**HINT:** Embed your screen captures as requested in the sections below. You can embed the image using the following syntax:

![Screen Capture #1](images/my-screen-capture.jpg)
```

The first argument is the Alt-text for the image. The second argument is the path to the image. Make sure your images are readable and that you save them in a JPG or PNG format.
